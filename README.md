This is my personal portfolio. As more projects are completed, 
it will be updated to include works best representative of myself and my work ethic!

This portfolio was written in React.js and bootstrapped through create-react-app.
I used this method to demonstrate the power and ease of using React to build Websites and Web Apps of all kinds.
In the poftolio I link to my social media as well as different methods to contact me and my personal blog that I'm writing
to help make learning all paths of JavaScript much easier. 

It's called JavaScript Reaction and you can check it out at

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
